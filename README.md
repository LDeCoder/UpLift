# UpLift
A project that utilizes HTML | CSS | JS | JAVA | SQL and a membership with credits used to earn badges, etc. 


The purpose of this repository is to show what I can create based upon a mockup requested by a client that I have created in Adobe Illustrator.  I also created the logo in Illustrator.  There are several HOME pages incorporated to showcase different styles of the same website but with a different look/feel.  I will also be creating a project in Java Spring to run in tandem with this website that will allow for user and admin sign in, credits to be earned and spent, as well as tracked within the website by simply logging in.  It's a work in progress and suggestions and feedback are welcomed and appreciated! Thanks for taking a look!
